# Quality Guidelines

> Code quality standards for Go backend services.

---

## Overview

Every backend service must remain independently testable, buildable, and
deployable. Quality checks run from each service directory because every service
owns a separate `go.mod`.

Minimum service-local checks:

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/server
```

When lint tooling is introduced, CI should run the selected linter for each
changed service.

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- Root-level Go module used to build all microservices together.
- Cross-service imports from `services/<other-service>/internal/...`.
- HTTP handlers that contain business rules, SQL, Qdrant queries, or MinIO object logic.
- Unbounded goroutines without cancellation.
- HTTP clients without timeouts.
- SQL built by concatenating user input.
- Panics for expected business errors.
- Global mutable state for request-scoped data.
- Logging secrets, tokens, raw credentials, or full sensitive payloads.

---

## Required Patterns

- Pass `context.Context` through request, service, repository, and infrastructure calls.
- Use graceful shutdown for HTTP servers.
- Validate environment configuration at startup.
- Keep service dependencies explicit in constructors.
- Keep business workflows in `internal/service/`.
- Keep persistence in `internal/repository/`.
- Use stable API response shapes: project-owned JSON APIs use
  `{ data, requestId }` / `{ error }`; AI Gateway model invocation success
  responses use OpenAI-compatible shapes as documented in
  `docs/services/ai-gateway/api/openapi.yaml`.
- Add or update tests for changed business logic.

---

## Testing Requirements

Use a risk-based test strategy:

| Change Type | Required Coverage |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Pure functions or validators | Unit tests |
| Service business workflows | Unit tests with mocked repositories/clients |
| Repository SQL changes | Integration tests when database test tooling exists |
| HTTP handlers | Handler tests for status code and response shape |
| Cross-service client changes | Contract-style tests or mocked HTTP server tests |
| Migration changes | Migration validation once tooling exists |

Test naming:

- Use `Test<FunctionOrBehavior>`.
- Prefer table-driven tests for validators, mappers, and policy decisions.
- Test expected errors explicitly with `errors.Is` or `errors.As`.

---

## Configuration Quality

- Read configuration from environment variables in `internal/config` using an
  `envconfig`-style structured loader.
- Validate all required variables at startup.
- Keep defaults safe for local development only.
- Do not read environment variables throughout business logic.
- Document required variables in service README or deployment docs.

---

## Code Review Checklist

Reviewers should check:

- [ ] Does the change stay within the correct service boundary?
- [ ] Are HTTP request and response contracts stable?
- [ ] Are errors classified and returned through the standard error shape?
- [ ] Is sensitive data excluded from logs and responses?
- [ ] Are database changes represented by service-owned migrations?
- [ ] Are Redis/Qdrant/MinIO responsibilities owned by the correct service?
- [ ] Are timeouts and context cancellation handled for external calls?
- [ ] Do tests cover the changed behavior?
- [ ] Can the service still run `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server` independently?

---

## Common Mistakes

- Adding shared code before three services actually need the same behavior.
- Testing only handlers while business rules remain untested.
- Treating Docker Compose startup as a substitute for service-level tests.
- Allowing the gateway to accumulate all business logic.
